            `In the current times, the use of technology has simplified and helped us improve our lifestyles, and it has advanced to the point where it is integrated in many aspects of our lives. We use technology to play games, create word documents, buy and sell goods online, and even control the lights in our houses through smart devices. Within the large field of technology, there is a wide variety of subfields that focus on its different applications. 
            
            So how can we use computers to help us in the matters of the stock market?`],
            
            ["Introduction to Computer Science and Machine Learning",
            `Typically, programmers write computer programs which consists of a set of instructions, or an algorithm, in order to tell the machine how to execute a particular task. 
            
            For example, if you want to tell your computer to buy milk from an online grocery store, you might write a simple program with the following instructions:

                Step 1: Go to the grocery store’s website.
                Step 2: Input “milk” in the search bar and click the search button.
                Step 3: Click the milk item and add one to cart.
                Step 4: Checkout with the payment information provided by the user.

            The computer is able to successfully buy milk from the store thanks to the explicit instructions in the program.`],
            
            ["Introduction to Computer Science and Machine Learning",
            `Another example of a program that tells a machine exactly what to do would be in applications like Gmail. Programmers code how users should log in or create accounts and what screen to display after they signed in. 
            
            The different ways that the users can interact with Gmail, like creating, reading, and deleting emails, are also directed by the programmers. With these programs, the programmers can control exactly how the application is run and managed. Programs like the ones in Gmail work well for tasks where there is a defined path or workflow in which we want the computer to follow. You can see these types of programs in almost all applications.`],
            
            ["Introduction to Computer Science and Machine Learning", 
            `But what if we do not want to give the computer the exact instructions for everything? For example, say we want the computer to look at a picture of a fruit and figure out what kind of fruit it is. We could write a program that tells the computer how to distinguish which fruit is in the picture.
            
            For instance, we could tell the machine that the fruit is an apple if it is red and round, an orange if the fruit is orange and round, and a banana if the fruit is yellow and long. This program might work for a majority of the apples, oranges, and bananas, but what if we show the computer an image of a green apple? The computer will not recognize the fruit in the image as an apple since it is not red. 
            
            We could add to the program that an apple could be green, but what if the next picture shown to the computer is of a red grape or a yellow apple? We would have to add more and more descriptions for each fruit in our program since there are so many varieties of fruit, and eventually some of the descriptions may overlap, be too precise, or be increasingly harder to define. 
            
            So, there must be a better way for the computer to figure out what fruit is in a picture without explicitly describing the features to it.`],

            ["Introduction to Computer Science and Machine Learning", 
            `Imagine if we could teach the computer what each fruit looks like just by showing them to the computer and having the computer learn and recognize the features of the fruits in a way similar to how humans learn. We could show a picture of an apple to the machine and tell it that the fruit is an apple. Then, we show the computer another picture of an apple where the shape and the color are slightly different from the previous one and tell the computer that this image is also of an apple.

            Labeled data is raw data that has been provided a tag, label, or class by human annotators to describe it in a meaningful way. The labeled data is used as training data and is fed to a model to help it learn distinguishing patterns in order to produce an output in the form of a prediction.`],

The teacher teaches the student what each data represents, and the student learns to recognize the common traits that characterize each representation. 
            
            In other words, the teacher is supervising the learning process, hence the name “supervised” learning. Then if someone presents the student with new unlabeled data that the teacher has not specifically shown them before and asks the student to identify it, the student will use the knowledge they have learned in order to guess or predict what the previously unseen data represents.`],

The computer then used what it learned from the labeled data to predict the identification of the fruit in new pictures. 
            
            The labels on the data also define what target answers we want the algorithm to return as output. In the fruit pictures example, since we taught the machine what fruit is in each image, we expect the machine to answer back in the form of a type of fruit when we ask it to identify a new picture of a fruit.`],

            Logistic regression is especially great at solving binary classification tasks. Binary classification is when there are only two categorical outputs that you want to try and predict. Some examples of binary classification might be whether or not an email is spam (spam or not spam) and whether or not a patient has a certain disease (ill or not ill).

            After receiving data, the model implicitly performs calculations on the inputs and passes them through the sigmoid function in order to return outputs between 0 and 1.

            This process will continue until the algorithm lands on a node and there are no more branches to follow. This node can be referred to as a leaf node, and it does not represent another condition.

            ["Unsupervised Learning Algorithm - K-Means", 
            `One of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms used for clustering is K-means. The main function of the K-means algorithm is to take in an unlabeled set of data and group the datapoints that are similar together. The “K” in “K-means” represents the number of clusters that the data should be split into, and it is predetermined and manually set by an individual. Additionally, since this is an unsupervised learning algorithm, it is up to an individual to make sense of the outputted clusters through a method like labels.`],

            ["Unsupervised Learning Algorithm - K-Means", 
            `The way that the K-means algorithm works is by grouping datapoints that are close together. In the beginning, a K value is chosen, and the algorithm plots the datapoints of the training data. The K-means algorithm also generates K number of initial points, called centroids, that represents the center of each cluster and have random locations. Then the algorithm assigns each datapoint to the cluster based on the nearest centroid. 
            
            After each datapoint has been grouped into a cluster, the K-means algorithm relocates each centroid by calculating the mean of each cluster and using it to position the centroids in their respective clusters. Since the centroid has changed positions, there may be certain datapoints that are closer to a different centroid. So, each datapoint is reassigned to their nearest centroid, and new centroid positions will be recalculated afterwards. This process continues until the positions of the centroids no longer change due to successful clustering. 
            
            In addition, it is important to note that, since the initial centroid positions are randomly generated, running the K-means algorithm multiple times on the same data set many result in different clustering of datapoints.`],

            ["Unsupervised Learning Algorithm - K-Means", 
            `Now that we have talked about how the K-means algorithm works, we can try applying it. Say we have a data set of the daily stock movements of 22 different companies, and we want to group the companies based on the movements. Some of the companies in the data are Apple, Amazon, Honda, Exxon, and Bank of America. 
            
            To make it easier to visualize, we have plotted a section of the datapoints on the scatterplot above. In order to group the datapoints, we will use the K-means algorithm.`],

            ["Unsupervised Learning Algorithm - K-Means", 
            `To start, we will set K = 6, which mean that the algorithm will assign the datapoints to six different clusters based on their distance to the initial centroids that will be generated. In the scatterplot above, we can see how the K-means algorithm clustered the points. The red dots represent the centroids’ final positions, which are located at the center of each cluster. The other colors represent the different groups that the datapoints fall into.
            
            From the clusters that the K-means algorithm found, we can then analyze for certain traits or similarities. In this case, we found that there were a lot of technology companies, like Apple, Microsoft, and Sony, in one cluster. Additionally, there was a cluster with automobile companies, like Ford and Toyota. Not all clusters show interesting findings, but there was enough information from some clusters hypothesize that that companies within the same field may have similar daily stock movements.`]

            `The third type of machine learning that we will briefly cover is semi-supervised learning. If you recall, supervised learning uses labeled data to train models and unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data. Accordingly, semi-supervised learning uses a mix of both labeled and unlabeled data when training models. 
            
            However, in what cases would we choose to use semi-supervised learning?`],

            ["Semi-supervised Learning", 
            `Most machine learning models are supervised learning models. However, in order to build a supervised learning model, you must have a large amount of labeled training data, and these data must be manually annotated by humans. Having a sizeable, labeled data set is pretty expensive in terms of resources and time. On the other hand, training a model with a small set of labeled data may not produce very good results. 
            
            So, while it would be optimal to train a model using only labeled data, there are many occasions where this might not be feasible.
            
            This is where semi-supervised learning comes in.`],
            
            ["Semi-supervised Learning", 
            `Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data for training purposes. 
            
            First, you would train the model with the smaller set of labeled data, just like in supervised learning. 
            
            Then, you would use the model to predict the labels of the larger unlabeled data set. These labels might not be as accurate as a hand-annotated label, but they will suffice in this case. 
            
            Finally, you would take the entirety of the set of labeled data and the set of previously unlabeled but now labeled data, and you would use it to retrain the model. 
            
            The goal is to get a final model that would provide better accuracy that a normal supervised learning model with the same small set of labeled data.`],
            
            ["Semi-supervised Learning", 
            `For applications of semi-supervised learning, this type of machine learning can be used for most situations where there is a limited set of labeled data and a large supply of unlabeled data. So, it is possible to turn a supervised learning task into a semi-supervised learning task. 
            
            There are cases where using a semi-supervised learning model is more optimal. These cases include document classification, speech analyzation, and website classification. 
            
            Overall, if you are able to build a supervised learning model with an adequate set of labeled training data, it is advised to do so due to its higher accuracy. However, a semi-supervised learning model would be more proficient in circumstances where it is not feasible to obtain a lot of labeled data.

            `The final type of machine learning that we will also only briefly cover is reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is unlike any of the other types of machine learning that we have previously discussed. 
            
            Reinforcement learning is used to train an entity on how to behave in a certain environment or when facing certain scenarios. Instead of taking in a training data set with all of the answers provided in the form of labels as in supervised learning, reinforcement learning forgoes a training set all together and uses a trial-and-error approach in order to learn what the correct behavior should be. Rewards and penalties are used to teach the entity which actions are most or least optimal, and the entity reforms their behavior to maximize rewards.`],

            ["Reinforcement Learning", 
            `You can think of reinforcement learning like training a dog. 
            
            Imagine that you just received a dog one day that has not gone through training yet, and you want to teach your dog how to behave in an acceptable manner. Your dog would be the entity undergoing reinforcement learning, and you would be taking on the role of giving rewards or penalties to your dog in order to teach him whether his actions are favorable or not. 
            
            Say your dog chews on your shoes. You then penalize him by scolding him for his actions, and your dog now learns that he should not chew on shoes. Afterwards, your dog successfully performs a trick you have taught him, and you might reward him for his success by giving him a treat. This lets your dog know that performing that trick is something that is praised and will get him more treats, so he will eagerly perform it again in anticipation of the treats. 
            
            After going through more training, your dog now knows which actions are suitable and which actions he should avoid doing. 
            
            This is basically how reinforcement learning works.`],
            
            ["Reinforcement Learning", 
            `Reinforcement learning is used for many different applications. 
            
            The most prominent field that reinforcement learning is used in is robotics. This method of learning is a great way for robots to learn how to interact with their environment. 
            
            Another common area implements reinforcement learning is personalized recommendations. Every time you perform certain actions, such as liking, positively rating, or buying an item, it rewards the recommendation system for showing you the item which gives an indication to show you other similar or related items. 
            
            Reinforcement learning is also applied in games to train artificial intelligence or computer players on how to play the game. The most famous example would be AlphaGo, which has defeated the top players of Go. Another example would be the computer player you play against in a game like chess.
