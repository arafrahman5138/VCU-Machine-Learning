So, one way to train it is to feed the algorithm 100,000 pictures of stop signs and then let it decide what is what. If it is a picture of a stop sign and it says it's a stop sign, then it succeeded.. If it says it not a picture and but it turns out it was a picture of a stop sign, then the algorithm will know it made a mistake and tweak itself slightly in hopes of making more correct answers."],

Within the large field of technology, there is a wide variety of subfields that focus on its different applications.

            For example, if you want to tell your computer to buy milk from an online grocery store, you might write a simple program with the following instructions:

                Step 1: Go to the grocery store’s website.
                Step 2: Input “milk” in the search bar and click the search button.

With these programs, the programmers can control exactly how the application is run and managed.

For example, say we want the computer to look at a picture of a fruit and figure out what kind of fruit it is. We could write a program that tells the computer how to distinguish which fruit is in the picture.
            
            For instance, we could tell the machine that the fruit is an apple if it is red and round, an orange if the fruit is orange and round, and a banana if the fruit is yellow and long. This program might work for a majority of the apples, oranges, and bananas, but what if we show the computer an image of a green apple? The computer will not recognize the fruit in the image as an apple since it is not red. 
            
            We could add to the program that an apple could be green, but what if the next picture shown to the computer is of a red grape or a yellow apple? We would have to add more and more descriptions for each fruit in our program since there are so many varieties of fruit, and eventually some of the descriptions may overlap, be too precise, or be increasingly harder to define. 
            
            So, there must be a better way for the computer to figure out what fruit is in a picture without explicitly describing the features to it.`],

            ["Introduction to Computer Science and Machine Learning", 
            `Imagine if we could teach the computer what each fruit looks like just by showing them to the computer and having the computer learn and recognize the features of the fruits in a way similar to how humans learn. We could show a picture of an apple to the machine and tell it that the fruit is an apple. Then, we show the computer another picture of an apple where the shape and the color are slightly different from the previous one and tell the computer that this image is also of an apple. After showing the computer a variety of apples, we also repeat the process for other fruits. 
            
            In the meantime, the computer will learn and pick out the distinguishing features of each fruit by itself instead of having us define them as we did in the previous method. After the machine has finished learning, it is now able to recognize a random image of an apple it has not been shown before and correctly identifies the fruit in the image as an apple through the distinguishing features it learned.

            After receiving data, the model implicitly performs calculations on the inputs and passes them through the sigmoid function in order to return outputs between 0 and 1.

            For instance, going back to the fruits example, instead of showing the computer labeled pictures of fruits, say we gave it pictures of the fruits excluding the labels. The computer will have to learn the patterns from only the pictures themselves. The computer might group the pictures showing a round, red fruit into one cluster, some other pictures showing a long, yellow fruit into second cluster, and pictures showing a round, orange fruit into a third cluster. Even after this phase, the computer still has no idea what each group of images actually represents. So, after the computer successfully groups the pictures, we will then manually label each of the clusters as apples, bananas, and oranges.`],

For instance, in the previous unsupervised learning fruit example, if there was an image of a green apple in the data set, the computer might not group that image in the same cluster that contained the images of red apples. So, unsupervised learning has a difficult time handling data that contains a wide spectrum of the same item or data that is too similar to one another but belongs to different items.

The “K” in “K-means” represents the number of clusters that the data should be split into, and it is predetermined and manually set by an individual.

In the beginning, a K value is chosen, and the algorithm plots the datapoints of the training data. The K-means algorithm also generates K number of initial points, called centroids, that represents the center of each cluster and have random locations. Then the algorithm assigns each datapoint to the cluster based on the nearest centroid. 
            
            After each datapoint has been grouped into a cluster, the K-means algorithm relocates each centroid by calculating the mean of each cluster and using it to position the centroids in their respective clusters. Since the centroid has changed positions, there may be certain datapoints that are closer to a different centroid. So, each datapoint is reassigned to their nearest centroid, and new centroid positions will be recalculated afterwards. This process continues until the positions of the centroids no longer change due to successful clustering. 
            
            In addition, it is important to note that, since the initial centroid positions are randomly generated, running the K-means algorithm multiple times on the same data set many result in different clustering of datapoints.`],

Some of the companies in the data are Apple, Amazon, Honda, Exxon, and Bank of America.

The other colors represent the different groups that the datapoints fall into.

In this case, we found that there were a lot of technology companies, like Apple, Microsoft, and Sony, in one cluster.
